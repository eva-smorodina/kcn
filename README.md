Integral transmembrane protein ion channels are involved in cell signaling, cellular and
environmental sensing, cell migration, cancer metastasis, transport, and metabolism as well as other
vital biological activities and medical importance. However, Integral transmembrane proteins
including ion channels are very difficult to study due to the requirement of optimal detergent to
stabilize them after removing them from the cell membrane. Accurate-predictions of 3-dimensional
protein structures by AlphaFold2 has a profound impact for biology, especially for structural
biology. Here we present the studies of several native potassium channels with 4-6 transmembrane
(TM) helical segments determined by X-ray crystallography and CryoEM, and their water-soluble
QTY counter parts predicted by AlphaFold2. In the native structures, there are hydrophobic amino
acids leucine (L), isoleucine (I), valine (V) and phenylalanine (F) in the transmembrane helices.
These hydrophobic amino acids are systematically replaced by hydrophilic amino acids glutamine
(Q), threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y). Thus, the QTY variants become water-soluble. We also present
the superimposed structures of native ion channels and their water-soluble QTY variants. The
superimposed structures show remarkable similarity within RMSD 2.3Ã… despite significant protein
sequence differences. We also show the differences of hydrophobicity patches between the native
potassium channels and their QTY variants. We explain the rationale why the membrane protein
QTY variants become water-soluble. Our study provides insight into the differences between the
hydrophobic helices and hydrophilic helices, and will likely further stimulate designs of water-
soluble multispan transmembrane proteins and other aggregated proteins.
